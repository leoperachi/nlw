## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Backend API** running on `http://localhost:3333` (required for full functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd web/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run linting with Biome

## 📱 Application Features

### 1. Create Room

- Navigate to the home page
- Fill in room name (minimum 3 characters) and description
- Click "Criar sala" to create a new room
- Rooms are immediately available in the room list

### 2. Join Room

- View existing rooms in the room list
- Click on a room to enter and start asking questions
- Each room has a unique URL: `/room/:roomId`

### 3. Ask Questions

- Enter your question in the text area (minimum 10 characters)
- Submit to receive AI-generated answers
- Questions appear immediately with optimistic updates
- Real-time status updates during answer generation

### 4. Audio Recording

- Navigate to the audio recording page: `/room/:roomId/audio`
- Click to start recording audio
- Audio is automatically uploaded to the backend
- Supports WebM format with noise suppression

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application expects the backend API to be running on `http://localhost:3333`. Update the API endpoints in the HTTP hooks if your backend runs on a different port.

### Biome Configuration

The project uses Biome for code formatting and linting. Configuration is in `biome.jsonc`:

- Extends the `ultracite` preset for modern code quality
- Uses semicolons as needed
- Fast formatting and linting

### Vite Configuration

- React plugin for JSX support
- Tailwind CSS plugin for styling
- Path aliases configured for `@/` pointing to `src/`

## 🎨 UI Components

The application uses a component-based architecture with:

- **Button** - Various button styles and states
- **Card** - Content containers with headers and descriptions
- **Form** - Form components with validation
- **Input** - Text input fields
- **Textarea** - Multi-line text input
- **Badge** - Status indicators
- **Label** - Form labels

All components are built with Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## 🔄 State Management

The application uses React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management:

- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately for better UX
- **Automatic Refetching**: Data stays fresh
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states
- **Cache Management**: Efficient data caching

## 📡 API Integration

The application communicates with a backend API through custom hooks:

- `useCreateRoom` - Create new rooms
- `useCreateQuestion` - Submit questions with optimistic updates
- `useRooms` - Fetch room list
- `useRoomQuestions` - Fetch questions for a specific room

All API calls include proper error handling and loading states.

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Optimistic Updates

When creating questions, the UI updates immediately while the API call happens in the background. If the API call fails, the UI reverts to the previous state.

### Audio Recording

The application supports browser-based audio recording using the MediaRecorder API:

- Automatic noise suppression and echo cancellation
- WebM format with 64kbps bitrate
- Real-time upload to backend

### Form Validation

All forms use Zod schemas for validation:

- Room names require minimum 3 characters
- Questions require minimum 10 characters and maximum 500 characters
- Real-time validation feedback

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.
